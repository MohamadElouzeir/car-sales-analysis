Project Kick-off Description

Project Title: Car Sales Analysis

Goal:
The purpose of this project is to study car sales data and discover useful patterns in the automobile market. By working with a Kaggle dataset about car sales, I will look at how sales change over time, which brands and models are the most popular, and how different factors such as year, region, or car type affect sales.

The project will begin with cleaning and preparing the dataset so that it is easy to work with. Then, I will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to calculate basic statistics such as averages, counts, and correlations. After that, I will create different visualizations like bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and heatmaps to make the results clear and easy to understand.

The final outcome will be a well-structured Jupyter Notebook that combines all the findings and visualizations in the form of a dashboard. This will give a clear picture of overall sales trends in the automobile industry and highlight customer preferences, seasonal effects, and the top-performing brands and models.

While the main scope of this internship is data analysis and visualization, in a more advanced or professional setting this type of project could also include machine learning. For example, predictive models could be built to forecast future car sales or to estimate demand for specific brands and models. Even though machine learning is not required here, keeping this in mind shows how the project could be extended further in a real-world scenario.
